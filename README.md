1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements.

The Gaming Room was a client that wanted to expand their existing game, Draw It or Lose It, from an Android-only application to a web-based, multi-platform environment. They needed a design that allowed multiple teams and players to compete across different systems, ensuring secure data storage, scalability, and consistent performance across platforms.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I did particularly well in organizing the design document so that it clearly communicated technical information in a way that non-technical clients could understand. I also made sure that each section—such as system requirements, architecture, and recommendations—flowed logically and addressed the client’s specific needs.

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working through the design document helped me think carefully about how all parts of the application fit together before writing any code. It forced me to clearly define how data should be handled, how users would interact with the system, and what technologies would best meet the client’s goals. This made the actual development process more organized and efficient.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could revise one part of my work, I would improve the section about system performance and scalability. I would include more details about handling high traffic, optimizing resource usage, and ensuring faster response times under heavy loads. Adding more measurable performance goals would strengthen the design.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on accessibility, ease of use, and performance. The design emphasized a responsive interface that works smoothly across different devices and operating systems. Considering user needs is crucial because the success of any software depends on how well it meets real-world expectations. A design that focuses on user experience ensures higher satisfaction and long-term usability.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

My approach was to break down the project into smaller parts and analyze each one individually—such as client needs, functional requirements, and implementation constraints. I also compared different platforms and environments to choose the best one for the client’s goals. In the future, I plan to continue using this structured and research-based approach, while also incorporating early feedback from clients and end users to improve the design before development begins.
